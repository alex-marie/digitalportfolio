    <h1 style="font-size: 200%">Welcome to my Final Project!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Final Project! In this project, I have created 6 pages that each contain different things. For this page, I will just talk about some of the work that I have done and some of the skills that I have learned throughout the course of this semester. When I first came into the class, I had no knowledge of how to code, but now as the semester is coming to an end I know how to efficiently code a webpage and add different elements to personalize a website for myself or for another company. Now that this class is slowly coming to an end, I am realizing the importance of learning skills in HTML and CSS.</p>
